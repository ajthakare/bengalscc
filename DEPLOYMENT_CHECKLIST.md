## Optional: Production Hardening

### After First Admin Created
For extra security, remove these environment variables from Netlify:
- [ ] `FIRST_ADMIN_USERNAME` (no longer needed)

Keep them in local `.env` for development/testing.

### Enable Logging (Recommended)

- [ ] Track admin actions (future feature)

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Immediate Issues**:
   - Revert to previous Git commit
   - Trigger new deployment
   - Verify old version works

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Re-run setup function
   - Check environment variables
   - Clear browser cookies

3. **Data Issues**:
   - Submissions are safe in Netlify Forms
   - Admin users in Netlify Blobs
   - Can manually recover if needed

## Support & Troubleshooting

If issues arise, check:
1. `ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Detailed troubleshooting section
2. Netlify function logs - Real-time error messages
3. Browser console - Client-side errors
4. Network tab - API call failures
