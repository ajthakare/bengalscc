# Player Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive player management system for Bengals Cricket Club that enables admins to manage player pool, track team assignments, monitor availability for fixtures, and generate statistics at both team and club levels.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
**Admin System** (Already Implemented):
- Authentication: JWT-based sessions with Netlify Blobs storage
- Admin pages: `/admin` (submissions), `/admin/users` (user management)
- AdminLayout with sidebar navigation
- Netlify Functions for CRUD operations
- PapaParse v5.5.3 for CSV parsing

**Teams** (Hardcoded in `/src/pages/teams.astro`):
- **Bengal Tigers** - White Ball Division 2 (WB-D2), Captain: Likith Gowda
- **Bengal Bulls** - White Ball Division 3 (WB-D3), Captain: Mazar Khan
- **Bengal Thunder Cats** - Pink Ball Division 1 (PB-D1), Captain: Sharan CK

**Fixtures** (CSV format):
- Location: `/src/data/fixtures.csv`
- 37 matches from November 2025 to March 2026
- Parsed with PapaParse in `/src/pages/fixtures.astro`

**Current Gap**:
- No season management system
- No player data management system (global pool)
- No core roster management (marking players as core to teams)
- No availability tracking for matches (admin-managed)
- No statistics calculation (multi-season)
- No fixture upload/management per season (currently using single CSV)

## User Requirements

1. **Season Management**
   - Create and manage cricket seasons (e.g., "2025-2026")
   - Track which season is currently active
   - Define teams for each season with flexible formats (T20, T30, T40, etc.)
   - Teams and formats can change between seasons

2. **Player Pool Management (Global)**
   - Bulk import players from Excel/CSV
   - Add/edit/delete individual players
   - Track simple player details: First Name, Last Name, Role, Email, USAC ID, Active Status
   - Players are NOT tied to specific seasons
   - Players exist in a global pool

3. **Team Roster Management (Core Status)**
   - Mark players as "core" to specific teams
   - Players can be core to multiple teams (e.g., different formats)
   - Admin can mark/unmark core status anytime during a season
   - Display core roster per team with historical tracking
   - View which players were core to which teams in previous seasons

4. **Availability Tracking (Admin-Managed)**
   - **Admin marks** which players were available for each fixture
   - **Admin marks** which players were selected/played in the game
   - Two-step tracking: Availability → Selection
   - Link availability data to specific fixtures
   - Add notes per player per fixture

5. **Statistics Dashboard**
   - Games played per player (team level + club level + career)
   - Availability rates per season and career
   - Selection rates (how often available players get selected)
   - Team-level and season-level summaries
   - Historical comparisons across seasons

6. **Bulk Operations**
   - CSV/Excel import with validation
   - Bulk delete players
   - Export player data and statistics per season

Store: "fixture-availability"
  - Key: "availability-{fixtureId}" → FixtureAvailability
  - Key: "availability-index-{seasonId}" → { fixtureId, gameNumber, date, team }[]

Store: "player-statistics"
  - Key: "player-stats-{playerId}" → PlayerStatistics (includes all seasons)
  - Key: "team-stats-{teamName}-{seasonId}" → TeamStatisticsSummary
  - Key: "season-stats-{seasonId}" → SeasonStatisticsSummary
```

### CSV Import/Export Format
**players-import.csv** (Global Player Pool)
```csv
First Name,Last Name,Email,USAC ID,Role,Status
John,Doe,john@example.com,USAC12345,Batsman,Active
Jane,Smith,jane@example.com,USAC67890,All-rounder,Active

   - GET: `?teamName=Bengal Tigers&seasonId=xxx`
   - Returns: TeamStatisticsSummary for specific season

4. **statistics-season-get.ts**
   - GET: `?seasonId=xxx`
   - Returns: SeasonStatisticsSummary (all teams aggregated)

5. **statistics-export.ts**
   - GET: `?seasonId=xxx&format=csv`
   - Export statistics to CSV (for specific season or career)

**Statistics Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
For each player:
  Find all CoreRosterAssignments where player was marked as core

  For each season where player was core to at least one team:
    For each team player was core to in that season:
      - Count total fixtures for that team in season
      - Count times marked wasAvailable = true (from FixtureAvailability)
      - Count times marked wasSelected = true (from FixtureAvailability)
      - Calculate availability rate = (timesAvailable / totalFixtures) * 100
      - Calculate selection rate = (gamesPlayed / timesAvailable) * 100

    Season club level:
      - Aggregate across all teams player was core to in season
      - Total fixtures (deduplicated by fixture ID)
      - Total times available
      - Total games played
      - Season availability rate
      - Season selection rate

  Career level:
    - Aggregate across all seasons
    - Total seasons participated in
    - Total fixtures (across all teams, all seasons)
    - Total games played
    - Career availability rate = (total available / total fixtures) * 100
    - Career selection rate = (total played / total available) * 100
```

**Step 4.2: Create Statistics Dashboard**
- File: `/src/pages/admin/statistics.astro`
- Features:
  - **Season selector** dropdown (or "All Seasons" for career view)
  - **Team selector** dropdown (or "All Teams")
  - View Mode toggle: Season | Career

  **Season View Stats Cards:**
  - Total Players This Season
  - Average Availability Rate
  - Average Selection Rate
  - Total Fixtures This Season
  - High Availability Players (>80%)
  - Low Availability Players (<50%)

  **Career View Stats Cards:**

## UI Patterns & Styling

### Reuse Existing Patterns

**From `/admin/index.astro`:**
- Table structure with checkboxes
- Bulk actions toolbar
- Search input with icon
- Modal overlays
- Loading/error/empty states
- Stats cards grid
- Page header with blue gradient (white text)

**From `/admin/users.astro`:**
- Form layouts
- Alert messages (success/error)
- Add/create forms in cards

const teamColors = {
  'Bengal Tigers': 'bg-orange-100 border-orange-300 text-orange-800',
  'Bengal Bulls': 'bg-blue-100 border-blue-300 text-blue-800',
  'Bengal Thunder Cats': 'bg-purple-100 border-purple-300 text-purple-800'
};
```

### Availability Status Colors
```typescript
const availabilityColors = {
  available: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-300',
  notAvailable: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 border-gray-300',
  selected: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-300' // Played in game
};
```

### Season Badge Styling
```typescript
const seasonBadgeColors = {
  active: 'bg-green-500 text-white',
  inactive: 'bg-gray-300 text-gray-700'
};
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All functions validate admin session using existing `validateAdminSession()`
- Reuse JWT + cookie pattern
- No public access to player management

### Data Validation
- Email format validation and uniqueness
- USAC ID uniqueness
- Sanitize all inputs
- Role validation (Batsman, Bowler, All-rounder, Wicket-keeper)
- Team name validation against existing teams

### Access Control
- Admin-only access
- Audit trail: createdBy, updatedBy fields
- Consider soft delete (mark inactive instead of hard delete)

### Privacy
- Don't expose player emails publicly
- USAC IDs kept secure (admin-only access)
- Secure export functionality (admin-only)

### Rate Limiting
- CSV import: Max 1000 rows
- Bulk delete: Max 100 players at once

## Summary

This plan implements a complete season-based player management system with:

**Core Features:**
- 🗓️ **Season Management**: Create and manage cricket seasons with flexible team formats (T20, T30, T40)
- 👥 **Player Pool Management**: Global player pool with simplified data (Name, Email, USAC ID, Role, Active Status)
- 🏏 **Core Roster Management**: Mark players as core to teams (can be core to multiple teams), manage anytime during season
- ✅ **Admin-Managed Availability**: Admin marks player availability AND selection for each fixture (based on core roster)
- 📈 **Multi-Season Statistics**: Track performance across seasons with availability/selection rates
- 📊 **Career Statistics**: Aggregate player stats across entire career
- 📁 **CSV Import/Export**: Bulk operations for global player pool
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering**: Search, filter by team/status/role, bulk operations

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ❌ **No player polling**: Admin controls all availability marking (not players)
- ✅ **Global player pool**: Players not tied to specific seasons
- ✅ **Core status per team**: Players marked as "core" to teams, can change anytime during season
- ✅ **Multiple team membership**: Players can be core to multiple teams (different formats)
- ✅ **Flexible teams per season**: Team names/formats can change between seasons
- ✅ **Admin fixture management**: Upload/manage fixtures per season (not single CSV)
- ✅ **Soft delete**: Mark players inactive (keeps historical data)
- ✅ **Two-step tracking**: Availability → Selection (both admin-managed)
- ✅ **Selection rate metric**: Track how often available players get selected
- ✅ **Simplified player data**: Only essential fields (no phone, jersey number, complex assignments)

**Technical Approach:**
- **Storage**: Netlify Blobs (seasons, players, fixture-availability, statistics)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (following existing patterns)
- **Frontend**: Astro pages with season-aware UI
- **Auth**: Existing JWT session system
- **CSV Parsing**: PapaParse (already installed)

**Integration:**
- Leverages existing admin infrastructure
- Links to fixture system
- Season-aware navigation throughout
- Follows established design patterns
- Maintains team color coding and branding

**Estimated Timeline:** 5-6 weeks part-time development
- Phase 1 (Season & Fixture Management + Foundation): 2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Import/Export for Players & Fixtures): 4-5 days
- Phase 3 (Admin-Managed Availability): 1 week
- Phase 4 (Multi-Season Statistics): 5-6 days
- Phase 5 (Polish & Testing): 4-5 days
