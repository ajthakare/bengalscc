                    <p class="text-body-base text-justified">
                        Bengals Inc. was established as a non-profit organization with a simple but powerful belief:
                        sport is a universal language that builds community, character, and opportunity. In a fast-paced,
                        digitally driven world, sports provide balance—nurturing physical health, mental resilience,
                        discipline, teamwork, leadership, and respect.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border-2 border-gray-200 hover:border-primary transition-all">
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading text-primary">What</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base text-justified">
                        At its core, Bengals Inc. promotes cricket across the Bay Area as both a competitive and community sport.
                        Cricket is the foundation, but our vision goes far beyond one game. We aspire to evolve into a
                        multi-sport community club—embracing running, volleyball, badminton, soccer, baseball, and more.
                    </p>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border-2 border-gray-200 hover:border-primary transition-all">
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading text-primary">How</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base text-justified">
                        Bengals Inc. achieves this by building organized teams and leagues, partnering with schools and local districts,
                        investing in youth development, and creating safe, well-governed pathways for participation. Golden State Cricket
                        Club (GSCC) is Step 1 in this journey—a move driven by the desire for a larger, more inclusive brand identity.
